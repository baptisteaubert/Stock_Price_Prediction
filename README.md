# Stock_Price_Prediction

## The report is in the pdf and the code is in two notebooks aside.
### The first notebook deals with the imports of data from the SEC EDGAR DataBase (be sure to set up your MongoDB environment before running the code) and the training of word vectors.
### The second one deals with price imports from the Quandl API (free accounts allow users to send 500 requests max a day so make sure to store the results) and the subsequent classification task using TensorFlow for DeepLearning implementation.

#### Feel free to reuse any part of the code but keep me posted if you find interesting results. Areas that I would like to explore include a fitting of the time horizon hyper parameter when it comes to performing the classification task. All the reference that I have used are included in the pdf.
